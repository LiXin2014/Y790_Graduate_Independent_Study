In 1999, the product lines not directly connected with computers, storage, and imaging were grouped into a separate company (Agilent), the stock of which was offered to the public in an initial public offering. The Agilent IPO may have been the largest in the history of Silicon Valley at the time. The company thus created in 1999 was an $8 billion company with about 47,000 employees, manufacturing scientific instruments, semiconductors, optical networking devices, and electronic test equipment for telecom and wireless R&D and production. Agilentís major product lines include: Test and measurement products such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, signal generators, spectrum analyzers, vector network analyzers, atomic force microscopes (AFM), automated optical inspection, automated X-ray inspection (5DX), in-circuit test, and electronic design automation (EDA) software (EEsof) Life science and chemical analysis products such as DNA microarrays, liquid and gas chromatographs, mass spectrometers, nuclear magnetic resonance, molecular and atomic spectroscopy products, remanufactured test equipment with discounts ranging from 20% to 50%. In addition to measuring hardware, Agilent has generated and offers comprehensive chemical databases.

Among these scientists is CanBasí CEO Dr. Takumi Kawabe, who had devoted his medical research activities toward finding new cures to treat cancer patients. After completing five years of post-doctoral research in the US, Dr. Kawabe returned to Japan, where, as Associate Professor at the Molecular Medicine Research Institute of Nagoya City University, he focused his research on identifying abrogators of the G2 checkpoint phenotype screening. identifying abrogators of the G2 checkpoint through cell cycle G2 checkpoint phenotype screening. Successful identification of the first hit from this approach prompted the genesis of CanBas, founded in 2000 with financial backing from venture capital and angel investors. CanBas has since generated a pipeline of products in various stages of development as anti-cancer therapeutic agents. Our lead product, CBP501, is currently being evaluated in randomized Phase II clinical trials in combination with cisplatin/pemetrexed for first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).

The journey from University of Michigan Medical School labs to clinical trials and field tests took over 25 years. Soundbites is the product of a leading scientistís lifelong research into the causes and treatment of preventable hearing loss. What he learned upended over a century of conventional wisdom. Most people think hearing loss is caused by loud noise damaging the eardrums.

Services performed by the resource staff include training in the operation of the sources, advice to users on the design of experiments using radiation, scheduling use of the sources, operating the sources when necessary, dosimetry for new experimental setups, and maintenance and repair of the resources.  When not in use by members, these facilities are also available to non-members on an increased-fee basis.  The primary resources of the facility are five Cs-137 irradiators and one image guided orthovoltage x-ray tube irradiator.  Two Nordion Gammacell 40 irradiators are primarily used for whole body irradiation of rodents or irradiation of attached cultured cells at a constant dose rate.  The Shepherd Mark I irradiator is used primarily to deliver radiation to animal tumors or other partial-body irradiations at dose rates comparable to those used in external beam radiotherapy.  However, this irradiator can deliver radiation at a broad range of dose rates for a variety of purposes, such as irradiation of cell suspensions or irradiation to high doses to sterilize implant material.  The Gammacell 1000 irradiator is used to irradiate suspension cultures at a constant dose rate.  The low-dose-rate irradiator, built in-house with a Shepherd 81 source, is used primarily to irradiate cell cultures at dose rates comparable to those used in tumor therapy with radioactive implants, but can deliver radiation at any rate below 2 Gy/hr and has also been used in studies of carcinogenesis from prolonged  exposure to low-dose-rate radiation.   An in-house-built image-guided small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) is now available to the Core facility.  The SARRP is designed to produce the same degree of dose delivery precision in animal models as is currently achievable in human patients.",https://www.assaydepot.com

This novel fusion mechanism promotes efficient delivery of the drug compound to the target, with very limited systemic distribution. Studies demonstrate that the Kereos particles can effectively deliver highly toxic compounds with no observable systemic or clinical toxicity. A wide range of drugs and targeting molecules can be incorporated into the Kereos nanodroplets, which allows for the development of targeted formulations of existing drugs as well as the targeted delivery of new drug compounds.",https://www.assaydepot.com

(the ìCompanyî) is a biotechnology company focused on developing therapeutics based on unique immune cells called natural killer T (ìNKTî) cells. NKT cells are a rare but central component of the immune system that plays a pivotal role in human health and disease. Upon exposure to glycolipid antigens, NKT cells secrete high levels of specific cytokines that stimulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system to eliminate these pathogens. During periods of repeated exposure to immune challenge, NKT cells play a regulatory role controlling the type and magnitude of the adaptive arm of the immune system to regulate antibody and cell mediated immunity. Recent evidence has clearly established the importance of NKT cells in human health and disease. The mission of NKT Therapeutics is to use the Companyís expertise to develop a pipeline of first-in-class NKT based therapeutics to treat sickle cell anemia, autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases, cancer, asthma and dermatitis.",https://www.assaydepot.com

Ocera,http://www.ocerainc.com/,"525 University Avenue Suite 610 Palo Alto, CA 94301","Oceraís lead program, OCR-002 (ornithine phenylacetate) is an ammonia scavenger, designed to treat hyperammonemia (elevated ammonia in the blood) and associated hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of patients with liver cirrhosis and acute liver failure or injury. When the liver is no longer able to remove toxic substances from the blood, there is an accumulation of such toxins, particularly ammonia.  Ammonia accumulation in the blood impairs brain cell function, and can lead to a neuropsychiatric condition called hepatic encephalopathy, or HE. HE is marked by a worsening of brain function, impaired cognition, uncontrolled movements and decreased levels of consciousness. If it progresses untreated, HE can lead to coma and death due to brain swelling. Currently, there are no drug treatments for HE that can be given intravenously to hospitalized patients with acute HE. Ocera believes there is a significant unmet need for an injectable drug that can rapidly and safely treat patients with acute HE, and it is developing OCR-002 to address this problem. In addition, OCR-002 is being developed as an oral formulation for chronic use to prevent recurrences of hepatic encephalopathy.",https://www.assaydepot.com

The system is extremely sensitive with capability to detect even 1% of cells responding to a particular stimulus while analyzing multiple cell populations in a parallel fashion. This allows for selectivity profiling by comparing compound activity on multiple receptors of interest expressed in different cell line populations including naive cells in one mixture thus tremendously reducing compound consumption and shortening analysis time. Our analysis software separates and independently analyzes each population stained with a specific combination of tracking dyes. With only one laser up to 9 different cell lines can be mixed and analyzed simultaneously in a single well, yielding a receptor selectivity profile on each test compound. With two additional lasers even higher number of concurrent cell sub-populations can be tested simultaneously.",https://www.assaydepot.com

Synome,http://www.synome.eu/,"Cambridge, United Kingdom","Synome provides in-depth cognitive profiling utilising a sophisticated battery of touchscreen tests. In these tests, the mouse typically views a display on the screen and makes a choice (to an image location on the screen) by touching the screen with a ìnose-pokeî. Correct choices are rewarded with food pellets or strawberry milkshake at the back of the box, and incorrect responses are punished with a ìtime outî and absence of reward. There are several important advantages of this approach to cognitive testing. Firstly, these tests are appetitively motivated and non-aversive, as animals are rewarded for making correct responses rather than being punished for incorrect choices. Using appetitive methods minimises the confounding influences of stress caused by aversive procedures. Also, the touchscreen testing method minimises motoric demand and potentially confounding experimenter influences during testing. Secondly, in contrast to more traditional methods of cognitive assessment (e.g. fear conditioning or water maze testing), touchscreen tests have superior translational potential, as they usethe same types of stimuli (objects and locations on a computer screen), and the same types of responses (screen touches) as human cognitive test routines, e.g. CANTAB- the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Thirdly, they assess neuropsychological constructs that are relevant for many human conditions but which are rarely studied in non-touchscreen tasks (e.g. attention and behavioural inhibition).",https://www.assaydepot.com
